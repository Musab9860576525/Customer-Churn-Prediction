# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project is a part of my data science studies and to get experience of working on real life usecases. 
####  Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to determine wether a customer will churn or not by analysing numbers of related attributes.
1) This kind of prediction will help companies to predict churning of customers prior to their actual churning.
2) Thus, it will be usefull for companies to retain the customer which are predicted to be churned by the model by treating them individually.

## Project Description
This project is a classical example of handling with imbalance dataset.<br>

<b>Target variable classes</b> <br>

* <b> 0 </b>(Customer not churned) <br>
* <b> 1 </b>(Customer chunred)<br>


<b>Steps followed</b> <br>
* Required Library Import

<b> Model Validation </b><br>

|Model|Recall|Precision|f1 Score|
|-----|------|---------|--------|
|Logistic Regression|0.91|0.91|0.91|
|Desicion Tree|0.87|0.83|0.83|
|Random Forest|0.93|0.93|0.93|
|KNN|0.78|0.82|0.76|
|Navie byes|0.88|0.88|0.87|

<b>Model Selection</b><br>
* Selected Model : Random Forest Classifier becoz it is giving higher <b>Recall</b>, <b>Precision</b>, and <b>F1 Score</b> than other models.
